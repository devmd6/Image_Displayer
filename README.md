# Image_Displayer
This project describes a Image displayer project which loads bitmap images (BMP) from an SD card inserted into the SD card reader module.
It reads the data in a contiguous manner and as such the card needs to be set up with the image files prior to reading them off. The microcontroller displays the images on the SD card on a 128x128 graphic lcd. It also employs a slideshow function that triggers the system to read the next image in a preset amount of time and a power button that puts the system in a low power state
